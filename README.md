The Book Rental System application represents an automated book rental service. 
The interface offers two types of menus: user menu and admin menu.
All users need to be registered.The system asks for the username and checks whether the user is registered, if not, it prompts users to register, and once registered, presents them with a menu where users can search for books in the catalog by ID, title, and author, and check if the selected book is available.
Registered users have also the ability to rent a book for a specific number of days, rate it from 0 to 5, return it, view the average ratings given by other users and view his own history of rented books. 

The Admin user utilizes a separate menu where they can add and remove books from the list and view statistics (e.g., which book is rented the most and the least, which book has the best or the worst ratings, which user has rented the most and the least books). Admin user can also view the history of rented books by username, view all users and remove a single user by id.
